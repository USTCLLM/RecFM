# RecFM

Comprehensive tools and projects and frameworks for developing foundation models tailored to recommendation systems, developped by the USTCLLM group at USTC, leaded by [Prof. Defu Lian](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/liandefu).

## Overview

RecFM is a collection of tools and frameworks designed to facilitate the development of robust and efficient recommendation systems. It includes a suite of modular libraries and technologies that cater to various aspects of recommendation system development, from data ingestion to model deployment.

## Projects

1. **RecStudio**: A modular recommendation system algorithm library that enables the rapid construction and efficient training of recommendation system models. It also features a visualization platform for better understanding and debugging of models.

2. **RecStudio4Industry**: The industrial version of RecStudio, designed for high-efficiency model construction and training. It supports data reading from industry-friendly data interfaces such as HDFS and offers quick model deployment and inference capabilities, ideal for building multi-stage recommendation service frameworks.

3. **CELA**: A cost-effective text embedding model alignment technology for recommendation systems. It converts any text embedding model into a text encoding model that is friendly to recommendation models.

4. **GRE**: A universal recommendation text embedding model that has been deeply trained and aligned on multiple public datasets across different recommendation domains. It serves multi-domain recommendation systems for text representation extraction.
